# dice game
This is a very simple python game where it will throw 3 dices each with 6 sides and you must guess the sum of all those numbers.

# Info
The code is open-sourced and I have written comment lines on almost everything explaining what it does and what it is. This is for people who wants to learn more about python. Also, you are allowed to copy the game and do whatever you want with it, idc. If there is any bugs or any wrong info that I might have written in the code then please make a edit.
